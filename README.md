# Lucid Computing Landing Page

A static website for Lucid Computing, featuring a landing page, insights blog, and content managed through CloudCannon CMS.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Lucid Computing website. The site showcases:
- **Landing Page** (`index.html`) - Main marketing page with hero, features, and CTA sections
- **Insights Blog** (`insights.html`) - Blog listing page displaying published articles
- **Article Pages** (`article.html`) - Individual blog post template

The site uses **Jekyll** for static site generation and is configured for deployment on **GitHub Pages**. It also supports **CloudCannon CMS** for content editing.

## Write a Blog Post

### OPTION 1: Pages CMS Editor

1. Go to https://app.pagescms.org/lucid-computing/landingpage/main/collection/blog 

2. Press "Add New Entry"

3. Create a new blog post. Content editors can use the CloudCannon interface to:
- Edit page content without touching code
- Upload and manage images
- Create and edit blog posts
- Manage blog post metadata (title, slug, date, author, tags, etc.)

4. Set `publish: true` in the frontmatter when ready to publish

### OPTION 2: Create a Markdown in your IDE


1. Create a new markdown file in `blog/posts/` with the naming convention:
   ```
   YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug.md
   ```

2. Add YAML frontmatter at the top of the file:
   ```yaml
   title: Your Post Title
   slug: your-post-slug
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   author: Author Name
   tags:
     - Tag 1
     - Tag 2
   image: media/image-path.png
   description: Short description for preview
   publish: true  # Set to true to publish the post
   content: |-
   # Your Post Content
   ```

3. Set `publish: true` in the frontmatter when ready to publish

## Local Development

To test the site locally with Jekyll:

```bash
# First time setup
bundle install

# Process posts and serve
make serve
# or: bundle exec jekyll serve
```

**Note:** The `make serve` command automatically processes blog posts before starting the server. The site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`

## Syncing with CMS Changes

### Why Divergent Branches Occur

When working with a CMS (like Pages CMS), you may encounter a "divergent branches" error when trying to pull changes. This happens because:

1. **CMS changes**: Someone edits content through the CMS, which commits directly to the `main` branch
2. **Local changes**: You make changes locally (e.g., fixing image paths, updating code)
3. **Divergence**: Both branches have different commits, creating a fork in the git history

Git needs to know how to reconcile these differences, which is why you see the error:
```
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
```

### One-Command Solution

Simply run:

```bash
make sync
```

This command does the following: 
1. **Fetch**: Downloads the latest commits from `origin/main`
2. **Merge**: Creates a merge commit combining CMS changes with your local work
3. **Regenerate**: Updates `data/processed_posts.json` and `_data/processed_posts.json` to include all published posts

If there are actual merge conflicts (same file edited in conflicting ways), Git will pause and ask you to resolve them manually. This is rare when CMS edits are separate from code changes.

## Blog Post Fields

Each blog post supports the following frontmatter fields:

- **`title`** (string) - Post title
- **`slug`** (string) - URL-friendly identifier
- **`date`** (date) - Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **`author`** (string) - Author name
- **`tags`** (list) - Array of tag strings
- **`image`** (image) - Cover image path
- **`description`** (string) - Short description for previews
- **`publish`** (boolean) - Whether the post should be published (default: true)
- **`content`** (rich-text) - Post content (markdown) - stored in frontmatter for CMS compatibility

## How It Works

- **Jekyll** processes markdown files in `blog/posts/` automatically
- Posts with `publish: true` appear on the live site
- Content is converted from markdown to HTML during build
- GitHub Pages builds the site automatically on every push
- No manual conversion scripts needed!
