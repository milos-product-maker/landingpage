      "description": "Why trusting cloud providers is no longer enough for enterprise AI workloads.",
      "content": "<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the implicit trust we place in cloud service providers is becoming a liability. Enterprises are pouring billions into AI models, yet they hand over their most valuable intellectual property—the models weights and the private data they process—to opaque infrastructure.</p><h3>The Trust Gap</h3><p>Traditional cloud security relies on SLAs and reputation. 'Trust us, we're secure.' But for regulated industries and mission-critical applications, promises aren't physics. We need cryptographic guarantees.</p>"

      "description": "Understanding Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and how they protect data in use.",
      "content": "<p>Data has three states: at rest, in transit, and in use. We solved the first two decades ago with encryption. Data in use, however, has remained the 'final frontier' of security. When a processor computes, it typically needs to see the data in plaintext.</p><h3>Enter the TEE</h3><p>Trusted Execution Environments create a secure enclave within the processor itself. Memory is encrypted at the hardware level. Even the operating system or the hypervisor cannot peek inside.</p>"
