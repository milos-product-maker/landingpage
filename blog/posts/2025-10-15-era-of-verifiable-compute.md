In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the implicit trust we place in cloud service providers is becoming a liability. Enterprises are pouring billions into AI models, yet they hand over their most valuable intellectual property—the models weights and the private data they process—to opaque infrastructure.

### The Trust Gap

Traditional cloud security relies on SLAs and reputation. 'Trust us, we're secure.' But for regulated industries and mission-critical applications, promises aren't physics. We need cryptographic guarantees.
