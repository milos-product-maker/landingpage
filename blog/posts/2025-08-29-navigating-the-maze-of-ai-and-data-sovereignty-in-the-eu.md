  # Navigating the Maze of AI and Data Sovereignty in the EU


  Governments across the European Union are increasingly focused on AI and data
  sovereignty. This trend is driven by a range of new regulations, from broad
  frameworks like the EU Cybersecurity Act to sectoral rules such as health,
  finance, government and defence. 


  For any organisation in Europe's digital ecosystem - from cloud, hardware, and
  network infrastructure providers to the public and private sector entities
  deploying critical systems - navigating this landscape has become a strategic
  necessity.


  In this post, we'll break down the key regulations driving these sovereignty
  obligations and introduce our solution for seamlessly and securely proving the
  sovereignty of your critical AI workloads and data: Sovereign Certificates.


  ## The Foundation: The EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA) and EUCS


  The EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA) serves as the legal foundation for harmonised,
  EU-wide cybersecurity certifications. It doesn't list specific controls but
  creates the rulebook for schemes like the upcoming EU Cloud Certification
  Scheme (EUCS).


  A critical part of the CSA is Article 52, which defines three "assurance
  levels":


  *   **Basic:** Protects against known risks.
      
  *   **Substantial:** Protects against attackers with limited resources.
      
  *   **High:** strongest assurance for critical use cases.
      

  This 'High' level provides the legal justification for embedding sovereignty
  requirements into EU-wide certifications. Drafts of the EUCS have considered
  doing just that by defining a key security objective as protecting data from
  unlawful access by third-country authorities, directly justifying the need for
  sovereignty controls. 


  **Raising the bar: France's SecNumCloud**


  SecNumCloud has already implemented strict sovereignty criteria. Drafted by
  the French cybersecurity agency (ANSSI),  it is currently the strictest
  sovereignty-focused certification in Europe. It goes far beyond simple data
  localisation to make a provider legally and structurally immune to non-EU
  legal overreach.


  Key sovereignty requirements in SecNumCloud include:


  *   **Protection Against Non-EU Law:** The provider’s corporate structure and
  headquarters must be in the EU. Strict limits are placed on non-EU ownership. 
      
  *   **Data and Operations Localisation:** All customer and technical data, as
  well as all administration and supervision, must be located and performed
  within the EU.
      
  *   **Legal Framework:** Service agreements must be governed by the law of an
  EU member state.
      

  ## A Sector-Specific Example: The European Health Data Space (EHDS)


  The trend towards sovereignty is particularly clear in critical sectors. The
  **European Health Data Space (EHDS)** is a prime example. This regulation aims
  to create a single market for digital health data, allowing researchers and
  innovators to access high-quality health data for the public good (known as
  "secondary use").


  To protect this highly sensitive information, the EHDS regulation mandates
  that this data can only be accessed and processed within **secure processing
  environments**. A core requirement is that these environments must be
  physically and operationally managed **within the EU**. Crucially, data within
  these environments **cannot be transferred to or accessed from third
  countries**. This creates a clear, legally binding sovereignty requirement for
  anyone wanting to access European health data via this initiative. 


  ## Sector-Specific Driver 2: Finance and the Digital Operational Resilience
  Act (DORA)


  Similarly, the financial sector is facing intense pressure to guarantee
  sovereignty. The **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)** harmonizes
  digital resilience rules for all financial entities in the EU. 


  A key focus for supervisory authorities, including the **European Central Bank
  (ECB)**, is the sector's heavy reliance on external cloud providers. Recent
  ECB guidance on outsourcing signals increasing scrutiny on the **location of
  hosted data and operations**. This is pushing banks, insurers, and investment
  firms to demand stronger guarantees of data sovereignty to ensure their
  operational resilience and regulatory compliance under DORA.


  ## Our Solution: Sovereignty Certificates


  Navigating these complex requirements can be both burdensome and technically
  unverifiable: usually relying on strict but blunt operational or personnel
  controls and contractual promises, not verifiable proof. **Sovereignty
  Certificates offer a streamlined, targeted solution** to ensure customers can
  simply and securely verify that their AI workloads and related data remain
  within their chosen jurisdiction. These both compliment and are meaningfully
  differentiated from the sovereignty standards mentioned in this article:


  *   **Complementary:** By meeting our standard, your organisation implements
  the core technical sovereignty controls required by SecNumCloud, the proposed
  'High' level of the EUCS, and sector-specific rules like the EHDS. This
  simplifies the path to full certification and helps meet obligations under the
  GDPR, Data Act, and ISO 27001.
      
  *   **Differentiated:** For customers who need to guarantee sovereignty
  without the overhead of a full SecNumCloud qualification, our certificates
  provide a powerful "Sovereignty Guarantee." This unlocks new, sensitive
  sectors like health and finance, offering a distinct competitive advantage.
      

  The gap between regulatory requirements and technical capabilities is
  widening. While regulations demand proof, traditional approaches offer only
  promises. Sovereignty Certificates bridge that gap with hardware-rooted
  verification that regulators can trust and customers can verify.


  ## Annex - EU Legislation Incentivising Digital Sovereignty


  |     |     |     |

  | --- | --- | --- |

  | **EU Law / Regulation** | **Key Sovereignty Incentive(s)** | **How it Works
  (Simplified)** |

  | **EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA)** | Creates a legal basis for sovereignty
  requirements in EU-wide certifications. | The Act's **'High' assurance level**
  is designed to protect against state-level threats, justifying the need for
  controls against non-EU legal access. |

  | **EUCS (Proposed)** | Aims to create a harmonized, high-assurance "sovereign
  cloud" standard for the EU. | The draft scheme proposes mandatory EU-based
  corporate structures and technical immunity from non-EU laws for its highest
  level of certification. |

  | **Data Act** | Legally protects EU data from unlawful third-country
  government access requests. Facilitates switching between cloud providers to
  prevent vendor lock-in. | It requires providers to reject non-EU government
  access requests unless they are based on an international treaty and removes
  technical/financial barriers to switching services. |

  | **GDPR** | Imposes strict conditions on the transfer of personal data
  outside the EU. | Data transfers to third countries are only permitted if that
  country provides an "adequate" level of data protection, creating a strong
  incentive to keep data within the EU. |

  | **NIS2 Directive** | Mandates that critical entities secure their supply
  chains and manage risks from ICT suppliers. | Forces essential entities (in
  energy, transport, health, etc.) to scrutinize their cloud providers, favoring
  those who can guarantee data and operations are managed within the EU to
  minimize supply chain risks. |

  | **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)** | Requires financial entities
  to manage and control risks from third-party ICT providers, including cloud
  services. | Pushes financial firms to demand stronger guarantees on data
  location and operational control from suppliers to ensure resilience and
  reduce cross-border dependency risks. |

  | **European Health Data Space (EHDS)** | Mandates a sovereign environment for
  the use of health data for research and innovation. | The regulation requires
  that sensitive health data for secondary use is only processed in a secure
  environment within the EU, with no access from third countries. |

  | **SecNumCloud (France)** | Provides a clear, auditable "gold standard" for
  what a sovereign service looks like. | Although a national standard, its
  strict rules on EU ownership, control, and operations heavily influence the
  EU-level debate and the design of the EUCS. |
