  ## Four Essential Properties of an America First AI Trade Policy

  From the Administration's perspective, an effective America First approach to AI trade policy should accomplish four critical objectives:

  1. Enable bilateral dealmaking leveraging America's AI chip advantage
  2. Ensure global competitiveness of U.S. semiconductor manufacturers
  3. Maintain the hardware edge for U.S.-based AI companies
  4. Prevent adversarial use of U.S. technology in weapons development and other security threats

  These properties represent the foundation of a trade policy that is supposed to put American interests first—but balancing them requires sophisticated policy mechanisms. Let's examine each in detail.

  ### 1. Enabling Bilateral Dealmaking Through AI Chip Access

  AI is becoming the most economically powerful technology in history. Within this administration, we'll likely see artificial general intelligence emerge. This could lead to a world where AI systems running on specialized chips handle nearly all important economic work. The administration has a unique opportunity: controlling who gets access to U.S.-made AI chips can become one of its strongest tools in global trade negotiations.

  This advantage provides a basis for strategic cooperation, allowing the United States to engage in bilateral discussions that foster mutual economic growth and innovation across diverse sectors—from manufacturing to agriculture to services. By collaboratively managing access to these critical components, the administration can facilitate tailored agreements that benefit both American economic interests and the economic development of its partners.

  ### 2. Ensuring U.S. Semiconductor Global Competitiveness

  Selling U.S.-developed and manufactured AI chips globally is essential for addressing trade imbalances and maintaining American dominance in semiconductor technology. The Trump administration's AI datacenter deals with the UAE and Saudi Arabia, worth billions of dollars, demonstrate how chip exports can significantly improve America's trade position.

  American semiconductor giants like NVIDIA and AMD must maintain their global market position to ensure continued leadership in chip design and manufacturing. Restricting their ability to sell internationally would not only harm these companies financially but could ultimately diminish American innovation capabilities as competitors grow stronger.

  ### 3. Maintaining the Hardware Edge for U.S. AI Companies

  However, to ensure the sustained leadership of American AI companies, it is crucial to manage the scale of access to advanced AI chips by foreign entities. This approach helps preserve the substantial advantages these U.S. firms currently hold in AI capabilities, revenue generation, and capital raised, which are largely due to their preferential access to cutting-edge AI hardware.

  This hardware edge has been acknowledged not only by the CEOs of leading American AI companies but also by their international counterparts. The founder of Chinese AI company DeepSeek has publicly recognized that limited access to advanced computing resources has significantly hampered their ability to compete with U.S. firms.

  ### 4. Preventing Adversarial Misuse of U.S. Technology

  Capable AI systems are recognized as a potential existential threat by the CEOs of all major AI labs, Nobel laureates, and the godfathers of modern AI. For this reason, it is critical that powerful AI capabilities don't fall into the hands of terrorists, dictatorial regimes, and U.S. adversaries.

  While AI offers enormous economic and social benefits, advanced models and large computing clusters could enable adversaries and malicious actors to enhance military and intelligence applications, lower barriers to developing weapons of mass destruction, support sophisticated cyber operations, and assist in human rights violations such as mass surveillance.

  ## Navigating Competing Priorities Through Technology

  A fundamental tension exists between the first two properties (enabling bilateral dealmaking and ensuring semiconductor competitiveness) and the latter two (maintaining a U.S. AI hardware edge and preventing misuse). If universal access to U.S. AI semiconductors is provided, it risks eliminating the advantage enjoyed by American AI companies and lose control over potential misuse by adversaries.

  The solution lies in implementing a proportional access framework: granting access to U.S. AI semiconductors based on the verifiable security guarantees that importers can provide. This approach allows the administration to finely calibrate its trade strategy, rewarding trusted partners while limiting access for less reliable actors.

  ### 1. Access Proportional to Security Guarantees

  The current regulatory framework for critical technologies employs tiered control levels based on destination, end-user, and item sensitivity. While this differentiated approach is appropriate, the allocation of access should be explicitly tied to the strength of verifiable, hardware-based security guarantees provided by the recipient.

  This framework translates into crucial questions across the AI lifecycle:

  - **AI Inputs**: "Where are the AI chips and other critical inputs located, and are global export controls being rigorously followed?"
  - **AI Training**: "Is a trained model undergoing and passing specific safety evaluations before deployment, with auditable and tamper-resistant records?"
  - **AI Deployment**: "Is the data of AI outputs and prompt logs being end-to-end encrypted, and in what jurisdiction is it stored, with assurances against unauthorized access?"

  ### 2. Development of Technical Standards

  Collaboration between the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and U.S. industry is needed to develop comprehensive technical standards and reference architectures for crucial security protections. Standardizing requirements for tiered access will clarify expectations and accelerate the development of compliant solutions.

  ### 3. Independent Third-Party Auditing

  Compliance with security standards must be verified through mandatory audits conducted by independent third parties. These auditors must be distinct from both U.S. exporters and foreign importers/end-users to ensure impartiality, similar to auditing practices in the financial sector.

  ### 4. Funding and Competitiveness

  The costs associated with implementing and auditing these crucial security guarantees will primarily be a responsibility of the foreign importers, reflecting their benefit from accessing advanced U.S. technology. Furthermore, the development of innovative hardware and software solutions required for compliance should foster growth among U.S. technology firms.

  ## Conclusion

  By implementing a system of proportional access based on verifiable security guarantees, the administration can balance competing priorities: enabling beneficial bilateral trade, maintaining U.S. semiconductor industry competitiveness, preserving the hardware edge for American AI companies, and preventing adversarial misuse of powerful technologies.

  This balanced approach ensures that America's technological leadership translates into economic and strategic advantages while safeguarding national security. As AI continues its rapid development toward artificial general intelligence, the policies established today will determine whether the United States maintains its position at the forefront of this transformative technology—with all the economic and security benefits that leadership entails.
