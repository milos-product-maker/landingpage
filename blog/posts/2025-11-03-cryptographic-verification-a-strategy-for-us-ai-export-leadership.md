  # Cryptographic Verification: A Strategy for U.S. AI Export Leadership


  ## The Problem: AI Trade Barriers


  The ambitious U.S. strategy to export the full American AI technology stack
  has encountered a powerful and predictable countervailing force: the global
  rise of digital nationalism. The long-held assumption of a single, integrated
  global digital market has gradually been rendered obsolete. In its place, a
  fragmented landscape of "regulatory fiefdoms" has emerged, driven by a
  deep-seated desire among nations to assert control over their digital futures.


  The global pursuit of "Sovereign AI" is a direct response to recent history.
  Supply chain disruptions and the clear strategic implications of technological
  dependence have alarmed governments worldwide. As a result, nations are
  launching multi-billion-dollar initiatives not just to participate in the AI
  economy, but to control their own AI infrastructure, data, and models. This
  has created a paradoxical environment for American technology providers. On
  one hand, the race for sovereign AI has generated unprecedented demand for
  U.S.-designed hardware, as allied nations rush to build domestic compute
  capacity. On the other hand, to ensure this new infrastructure is truly
  "sovereign," these same nations are erecting complex regulatory barriers that
  govern data storage, model management, and content control, directly
  threatening the high-margin software and services that run on that hardware.


  The core of the problem lies in a fundamental conflict of interests. The
  United States, motivated by legitimate national security and economic
  concerns, seeks maximum control and visibility over its exported technology.
  This is essential to prevent misuse, protect intellectual property, and ensure
  the technology cannot be turned against American interests.


  Conversely, "sovereign buyers"—from highly regulated markets in the European
  Union to ambitious emerging powers in Asia and the Middle East—demand the
  exact opposite. They seek maximum sovereignty, which they define as complete
  control over their critical digital infrastructure and the data that flows
  through it. They are increasingly skeptical of relying on a technology stack
  that is ultimately beholden to the laws and strategic interests of another
  nation. This skepticism is actively fueled by competitors like China, which
  promotes a narrative of American untrustworthiness, warning of hidden
  "backdoors" and "kill switches" in U.S. technology. This narrative erodes the
  trust necessary for deep technological partnerships and makes the sale of an
  American-controlled stack more challenging.


  This conflict manifests as a web of national and regional regulations that
  will increasingly pose barriers to entry in key global markets. The EU's data
  localization rules, for example, could favor local European cloud providers if
  US providers cannot provide robust guarantees on where the data goes. Similar
  trends are arising in the Middle East and Asia. To win the infrastructure
  race, the United States must offer a solution that seamlessly and technically
  addresses these sovereignty concerns, moving beyond legal assurances to
  provide demonstrable proof.


  ## The Solution: Trust Through Cryptographic Verification


  In the current zero-trust geopolitical environment, policy assurances and
  contractual obligations are insufficient to overcome the sovereignty paradox.
  A sovereign buyer concerned about a "kill switch" or data access under the
  U.S. CLOUD Act will not be placated by a clause in a service-level agreement.
  One viable path to resolving this trust deficit is to build the American AI
  stack on a foundation of cryptographic verification. This approach moves the
  basis of trust from the identity of the operator to the provable mathematical
  properties of the system itself, offering sovereign buyers demonstrable proof
  of compliance and control.


  The strategic challenge is to bridge the gap between the promise of security
  and the proof of it. The American technology stack must evolve from a model
  that says, "We promise not to access your data," to one that can state, "We
  have cryptographic protections that make unauthorized access extremely
  difficult and detectable, and we can prove it to you on demand." This shift
  from policy-based compliance to evidence-based assurance is the key to
  unlocking high-friction international markets.


  This new paradigm of demonstrable proof is made possible by a confluence of
  mature technologies that, when integrated, provide a verifiable chain of trust
  from the silicon to the application.


  ### Confidential Computing & Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)


  TEEs are secure, isolated areas within a main processor, such as those
  provided by Intel SGX/TDX or AMD SEV. They create protected memory enclaves
  where code and data are isolated during processing. Even an administrator with
  root privileges on the host operating system—or the cloud provider
  itself—cannot see or modify what is inside the TEE. This provides a powerful
  guarantee of data confidentiality and code integrity.


  ### Hardware Roots of Trust (HRoT)


  An HRoT, typically a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), is a dedicated microchip
  designed to provide secure hardware-based functions. It acts as the immutable
  foundation of trust for a computing platform. It can securely store
  cryptographic keys and, most importantly, can measure (cryptographically hash)
  the state of the system's firmware and software during the boot process,
  creating a secure log of the platform's configuration.


  ### Remote Attestation


  This is the protocol that makes the internal state of the system visible to an
  external party. A remote user (the sovereign buyer) can challenge the TEE or
  TPM. In response, the hardware provides a signed report containing the
  measurements of the software running on the system. This report is signed with
  a cryptographic key that is fused into the silicon and can be verified against
  the manufacturer's public key. This allows the buyer to receive strong
  cryptographic evidence of the hardware and software configuration at boot time
  where their workload is running, confirming that it has not been tampered with
  and matches an approved configuration.


  This fundamental security architecture is not just confined to CPUs; it is now
  a critical design pillar across the spectrum of modern AI accelerators.
  Recognizing that proprietary AI models and sensitive training datasets are
  immensely valuable assets, manufacturers like NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Google
  embed these hardware primitives directly into their GPUs and TPUs. These
  foundational technologies enable a range of specific, verifiable guarantees
  that directly address the concerns of sovereign buyers. These guarantees are
  not abstract principles but concrete deployment-ready capabilities that the
  American AI Technology Stack can provide to meet the demand for sovereignty
  from global customers.


  *   **A. Data Residency:** Is all data processing and storage confined within
  our nation's jurisdiction?

  *   **B. Confidentiality:** Is citizen and business data encrypted and
  protected from all unauthorized access?

  *   **C. Benchmarks:** Has the AI model been validated against our national
  benchmarks for performance, safety, and compliance?

  *   **D. Usage:** Does the data center, including all model training
  activities, adhere to local regulations and compute usage restrictions?


  Verifiable guarantees fundamentally alter the power dynamic between the
  technology provider and the sovereign customer. A U.S. company can build and
  operate the world's most advanced AI infrastructure, while a foreign
  government or enterprise can use that infrastructure with strong cryptographic
  assurances that their data and workloads remain exclusively under their
  control. While customers must still trust the underlying hardware
  manufacturers and implementation, the reliance on trusting the provider's
  legal entity or home jurisdiction is substantially reduced—the basis of trust
  shifts toward verifiable technical controls rather than policy commitments
  alone.


  Furthermore, a platform architected around these principles can transform
  regulatory compliance from a manual, periodic, and costly audit process into a
  more automated, semi-continuous, and technically verifiable process. Instead
  of an auditor reviewing logs to verify data residency, the platform can
  generate cryptographic attestations that provide strong evidence that a
  workload ran exclusively on servers within a specific national border and in
  an isolated environment configured to restrict external network access. This
  allows U.S. firms to sell verification as a premium, high-margin service,
  turning trade barriers into a source of competitive advantage, especially in
  relation to the Chinese AI Technology Stack.


  ## Deployment Configurations: A Framework for Global Markets


  A successful global deployment strategy requires a nuanced understanding of
  the different ways the American AI stack can be configured, and what
  international trade barriers exist around each such configuration. The
  following three-axis model provides a framework for analyzing deployments:


  ### Axis 1: Operator (The "Who")


  *   **O1: US Entity:** The data center is built, owned, or operated by a U.S.
  corporation (e.g., AWS, Oracle) or a U.S. government entity.

  *   **O2: Host Nation Entity:** The data center is operated by a non-U.S.
  entity, such as a private French company, a German state-owned utility, or a
  sovereign wealth fund.


  ### Axis 2: Jurisdiction (The "Where")


  *   **J1: US Homeland:** The physical data center is located in the United
  States and is subject to U.S. law, with foreign customers accessing it
  remotely.

  *   **J2: Partner Nation (Regulated):** The physical data center is located
  within the borders of a partner nation (e.g., France, Germany, Japan) and is
  subject to its local laws, such as GDPR.


  ### Axis 3: Technology Stack (The "What")


  *   **S1: US Model on US Hardware:** The complete American stack, featuring a
  U.S.-developed AI model running on U.S.-designed hardware.

  *   **S2: US Model on Foreign Hardware:** A U.S. AI model running on hardware
  from a non-U.S. manufacturer.

  *   **S3: Foreign Model on US Hardware:** A foreign-developed AI model (e.g.,
  France's Mistral) running on U.S.-designed hardware.

  *   **S4: Foreign Model on Foreign Hardware:** A completely non-U.S.
  technology stack.


  These axes define a spectrum of deployment scenarios, each with unique trust
  and regulatory implications. For example, an O1/J1/S1 deployment (AWS running
  a U.S. model in Virginia) is the default for many U.S. customers but is the
  most challenging to sell into high-sovereignty markets. Conversely, an
  O2/J2/S3 deployment (a German company running a French model on U.S. hardware
  in Frankfurt) presents a very different proposition that can be tailored to
  meet stringent EU requirements. The strategic goal should not be to force a
  single configuration on the world, but to sell a verifiable platform that
  enables a menu of secure, sovereign-respecting configurations. The product is
  not the stack; the product is verifiable trust.


  ## Overcoming the Industry Coordination Problem


  The primary obstacle to deploying a verifiably sovereign American AI
  Technology Stack is not a lack of technology, but a classic industry
  coordination problem. The capabilities for verification, based on technologies
  such as confidential computing and cryptographic attestation exist, yet they
  remain siloed within specific layers of the technology stack, making it
  difficult to deliver the integrated, end-to-end assurance that sovereign
  buyers demand. For example, a chip maker like Intel can attest to its hardware
  security properties, a cloud provider like Amazon can attest that a virtual
  machine is running on that chip, and an AI company can attest that its model
  is untampered with—but these attestations are not standardized or easily
  composable, leaving the customer unable to verify the entire process
  end-to-end through a single, unified chain of evidence.


  This creates a "chicken-and-egg" problem. While vital work on technical
  standards is underway in bodies like the Confidential Computing Consortium,
  Internet Engineering Task Force, and the Open Compute Project, the traditional
  process of industry-wide consensus and adoption takes decades. Crucially, the
  United States does not have decades. To win the current AI arms race and
  secure its technological leadership, it must solve this problem during this
  presidency. To effectively address the industry coordination problem, the
  Request for Proposal (RFP) for the American AI Technology Stack should be
  enhanced to cultivate products for digital trust. This can be achieved by
  embedding two core principles into the RFP requirements:


  ### 1) Mandate Integration with Independent Verification Technology Providers


  The RFP should explicitly require that all submitted "full-stack AI technology
  packages" are integrated with a Third-Party Verification Technology Provider.
  These providers—which include the existing market of technical audit firms,
  privacy platforms, and cybersecurity companies—would be responsible for
  aggregating and presenting the cryptographic attestations that build customer
  trust in privacy, data residency, and system configuration. Their third-party
  independence is crucial for building impartial trust, as it avoids the
  inherent conflict of interest that arises when a technology provider, such as
  a hyperscaler, verifies its own systems.


  Moreover, by making third-party verification a prerequisite for purchase, the
  financial burden of complying with international AI trade barriers shifts from
  American technology companies to the sovereign buyers themselves. This
  strategic shift not only alleviates the compliance costs but also cultivates a
  new, lucrative market for American firms specializing in verification
  technology.


  ### 2) Align Federal Incentives to Build the Verification Market


  The RFP should directly link the federal financing tools mentioned in the
  Executive Order to the costs incurred by both the stack providers and their
  Verification Technology Provider partners. This approach addresses the current
  economic misalignment by funding the development and integration of the
  verification layer. By offering loans, guarantees, and other de-risking
  mechanisms, the government can accelerate the creation of a robust and
  competitive verification market.


  A priority AI export package selected under these terms would help establish a
  de facto industry standard for verifiable sovereignty, positioning the
  American AI Technology Stack as not only the most powerful but also the most
  demonstrably trustworthy solution for sovereign buyers on the global stage.
