## Feature 1: No-Code Audits
**Heading**: Zero Code Injection
**Description**: An "Auditor" is simply a standard OCI container. We inject these auditors as sidecars into your Pod for seamless, standards-based integration.

**Heading**: Build with Ease
**Description**: Use our SDK to transform scripts into compliant Auditors that fit your policies.

**Heading**: Marketplace Approach
**Description**: Pull pre-built auditors for frameworks like ITAR, GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, or EU AI Act, from our marketplace.

## Feature 2: High-Level Problem ("Unlock The Blocked Majority")
**Heading**: Unlock The Blocked Majority

**Card 1 Heading**: Opaque Execution
**Card 1 Text**: Enterprises cannot verify if your cloud is running the exact model and weights they paid for.

**Card 2 Heading**: Data Sovereignty
**Card 2 Text**: Clients need physics-based proof of where their data is processed, not just legal agreements.

**Card 3 Heading**: Regulatory Paralysis
**Card 3 Text**: GDPR, ITAR, and HIPAA compliance blocks high-value workloads from moving to commodity clouds.

## Statistics
**Stat 1**: 74% - Adoption Barrier - Cite security & compliance as top blocker
**Stat 2**: 68% - IP Risk - Fear intellectual property loss in cloud
**Stat 3**: 27% - Active Bans - Have banned GenAI due to privacy breaches
**Stat 4**: $1M+ - Per Violation - ITAR, HIPAA, GDPR Compliance Failures

## Feature 3: AI Passports (Audit Automation)
**Section Title**: AI Passports: Automated Compliance Artifacts

**Check 1 Heading**: Audit Automation Tools
**Check 1 Text**: Passports are digital artifacts you can hand to a regulator or an API to instantly prove compliance—replacing paper documentation with cryptographic proof.

**Check 2 Heading**: Unlock High-Value Workloads
**Check 2 Text**: Bridge the infrastructure gap between convenience and security to move the 95% of enterprise AI pilots into production.

**Check 3 Heading**: Verifiable Sovereignty
**Check 3 Text**: Eliminate opaque execution and replace generic SLAs with physics-based proof of where and how your data is processed.

## FAQ Section
**Q1**: Does this rely entirely on TEE security?
**A1**: No. While we leverage hardware TEEs (Intel TDX/SGX, AMD SEV) for the strongest isolation guarantees, our verification layer provides additional cryptographic attestation. We are transparent about hardware dependencies and recommend defense-in-depth strategies.

**Q2**: Can I use this on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure?
**A2**: Yes. Lucid supports multi-cloud deployments. We work with confidential computing instances available on major hyperscalers (AWS Nitro Enclaves, Azure DCsv3, GCP Confidential VMs) as well as on-premise and sovereign cloud providers.

**Q3**: Who is the actual customer?
**A3**: Lucid serves both technical and business stakeholders. While developers install and integrate the platform, the Compliance Officers, CROs, and General Counsels are the economic buyers who benefit from reduced audit burden and regulatory risk.

**Q4**: What happens if I'm already using model guardrails?
**A4**: Lucid complements existing guardrails. Our Auditor Chains wrap around your existing safety measures, adding cryptographic attestation and audit trails. We don't replace your safety stack—we make it provable.
